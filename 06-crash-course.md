# Lovable Crash Course

Learn how to leverage AI to build and launch successful products.

## Module 1: Getting Started with Lovable 101

By the end, you'll have a simple application up and running with authentication and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing notes.

### Setting Up Supabase

Supabase is an open-source database service built on PostgreSQL. It provides authentication, data storage, and file storage—perfect for Lovable integration.

1. **Create an Organization & Project**
   * Log into [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
   * Create an **organization** (name it based on your startup or project).
   * Create a **new project** within that organization.
   * Note your **Supabase URL** and **API key** (you'll need them later).

2. **Configure Authentication**
   * Navigate to **Authentication > Sign In/Sign Up**.
   * Enable **Email authentication**.
   * Turn off **Confirm Email** (since we don't have an email provider set up yet).

### Creating a Lovable Project

Now, let's set up a project in Lovable.

1. **Start with a Fresh Blank Project**
   * Open Lovable and create a **new project**.
   * Keep your first prompt simple: *"Create a blank project"*.
   * Lovable will generate the basic structure for your app.

2. **Connect Supabase to Lovable**
   * In Lovable, navigate to the **database settings**.
   * Enter your **Supabase project URL and API key**.
   * Click **Connect** to link your Lovable project to Supabase.

### Adding a Login System

1. **Create a Navigation Bar with a Login Button**
   * Add a **nav bar** at the top of your project.
   * Include a **Login** button that redirects users to a login page.

2. **Apply SQL Changes for Authentication**
   * Lovable will generate SQL for Supabase to handle authentication.
   * Click **Apply Changes** to execute the SQL commands.

### Using the Visual Edit Tool

1. **Customize the UI**
   * Open the **Edit Tool** in Lovable.
   * Click on UI elements (e.g., buttons) to modify styles.
   * Ensure all text is visible (e.g., black text on white backgrounds).

### Testing the Login System

1. **Create a Test Account**
   * Use the **Sign Up** form to create a new user.
   * Verify that login and logout workflows function correctly.

2. **Redirect Users to a Dashboard After Login**
   * Modify the authentication flow to send users to a **dashboard** after login.

### Adding Notes (CRUD Functionality)

1. **Set Up a Notes Table in Supabase**
   * Use Lovable to generate SQL for a **Notes** table.
   * Ensure it has **user ID** and **content** fields.
   * Click **Apply Changes** to create the table.

2. **Build the Notes UI**
   * Add a **table to display notes** on the dashboard.
   * Include an **input field** and **buttons** for CRUD operations.

3. **Test CRUD Operations**
   * Add a new note.
   * Edit an existing note.
   * Delete a note.
   * Verify notes persist in Supabase.

### Debugging with Chat Mode

To enable Chat Mode, go to **Settings > Accounts Settings** tab.

1. **Identify Errors**
   * If an issue arises, enable **Chat Mode**.
   * Lovable will analyze **Supabase logs** and **TypeScript errors**.

2. **Apply Fixes**
   * Review Lovable's debugging suggestions.
   * Apply fixes as needed.

## Module 2: Building Interactive UIs

In this module, we'll cover components, reusable UI elements, design improvements, and debugging best practices.

### Understanding Components

Components in Lovable help organize UI elements into modular and reusable parts. Instead of having all UI elements in a single page (e.g., a 400-line dashboard), we break them into components such as:

* **Sidebar**
* **Welcome Card**
* **Quote Card**
* **Notes Section**

This structure improves efficiency when making edits since changes apply only to specific components rather than the entire page.

### Creating and Using Components

1. **Identify Large UI Sections** – Look for UI parts that repeat or are too large.
2. **Refactor Into Components** – Use Lovable's chat mode to scan the code and suggest an optimized structure.
3. **Reuse Components** – Copy and paste components across pages for consistency.

### Editing UI Efficiently

1. **Modify Individual Components**
   * Instead of modifying the full dashboard, edit smaller components like the **Welcome Card**.
   * Run a prompt: *"Update the copy in the Welcome Card to make it more engaging."*

2. **Use Chat Mode for Refactoring**
   * Ask Lovable to refactor large UI sections into smaller components.
   * Example: *"Refactor the dashboard into smaller, cleaner components."*

### Enhancing UI with Pre-Built Components

If you're not a designer, leveraging pre-built styles can improve your app's appearance.

1. **Using 21st.dev for UI Inspiration**
   * Visit [21st.dev](https://21st.dev/?tab=components&sort=recommended) to explore pre-built UI components.
   * Choose a design, copy its prompt for Lovable, and integrate it into your project.

2. **Creating Global Styles**
   * Modify an element on the project, for eg: *"Set a button as Rainbow Button".*
   * Add this system prompt in the project settings' knowledge to ensure all new buttons follow this style: "When creating components, make sure to always use our global rainbow button".
   * Everytime you add a button, this pre-set style will be respected.

### Redesigning the Dashboard

To update the dashboard layout:

1. Find a **design you like** (e.g., on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)).
2. **Screenshot the relevant section** and upload it to Lovable.
3. **Provide clear instructions**, such as:
   * *"Refactor the dashboard layout based on this design."*
   * *"Place notes in a left-hand sidebar, and open them in a side-by-side editable view."*

### Implementing Real-Time Updates

1. **Enable Real-Time Sync for Notes**
   * Run a prompt: *"Enable real-time updates for notes so that changes reflect instantly."*
   * Ensure data updates in both the **sidebar** and **editing panel**.

2. **Debugging UI Issues**
   * Use chat mode to scan the implementation and fix missing updates.
   * Example: *"When editing the title in the side-by-side view, it doesn't save. Fix this issue."*

### Refining the Note Editing Experience

1. **Use Mobbin for Real-World UI Examples**
   * Search for "note-taking UI" to see how popular apps design their interfaces.
   * Example: A clean, minimalistic note editor with large titles and a dropdown for tags.

2. **Applying UI Improvements**
   * Ensure the title is **large and prominent**.
   * Add **tags via a dropdown**, similar to the reference UI.
   * Example prompt: *"Redesign the note editor to match this screenshot. Use a large title, white space for content, and dropdown-based tags."*

### Debugging and Final Touches

1. **Fix UI Bugs**
   * Run a prompt: *"Fix the issue where note tags don't save after editing."*
   * Ensure all UI elements update correctly when modified.

2. **Optimize Button Styling**
   * Adjust button and input styling to match the intended design.
   * Example: *"Ensure all buttons use the global Rainbow Button style."*
