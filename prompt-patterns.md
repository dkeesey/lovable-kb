# Lovable Prompt Patterns

This reference guide contains effective prompt patterns for common tasks in Lovable. These are designed to help you extract maximum value with minimal message usage.

## Initial Project Setup

### Creating a New Project
```
Create a [type] app with the following features:
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]

Start by setting up the main layout with a navigation bar and homepage.
```

### Connecting Supabase
```
Connect this project to Supabase for backend functionality. I need authentication and data storage for [describe data entities].
```

## Incremental Development

### Adding Authentication
```
Add a login and registration system with email authentication. Include a user profile page that shows after login.
```

### Creating Database Tables
```
Create a database schema for [entity] with the following fields:
- [Field 1]: [Type] (description)
- [Field 2]: [Type] (description)
- [Field 3]: [Type] (description)

Implement proper Row Level Security to ensure users can only access their own data.
```

### Building CRUD Functionality
```
Create a complete CRUD interface for managing [entities]. Include a table view with search and sort capabilities, and a form for adding/editing records.
```

## UI Improvements

### Using a Design Reference
```
Redesign the [component/page] based on this screenshot. Maintain all existing functionality but update the visual appearance to match this design.
```

### Implementing Components
```
Refactor the [section] into a reusable component. It should accept the following props:
- [Prop 1]: [Type] (description)
- [Prop 2]: [Type] (description)
```

### Responsive Design
```
Optimize the [page/component] for mobile devices. Ensure all content is accessible and usable on small screens without horizontal scrolling.
```

## Integration Patterns

### Adding Stripe Payments
```
Implement Stripe payment processing for [product/subscription]. Create a checkout page and handle successful payment callbacks to update user access.
```

### OpenAI Integration
```
Add AI capabilities using OpenAI. I need a feature that [describe AI feature] when users [describe trigger action].
```

## Debugging

### Fixing Errors
```
The [feature/component] is not working as expected. Here's the error from the console:
[Paste error text]

Please investigate and fix the issue while maintaining the existing functionality.
```

### Performance Optimization
```
The [page/component] is loading slowly. Optimize the data fetching and rendering to improve performance without changing the UI or functionality.
```

## Advanced Features

### Real-time Updates
```
Enable real-time updates for [entity/feature] so changes are immediately visible to all users without requiring a page refresh.
```

### Search Functionality
```
Implement a search feature that allows users to find [entities] by [fields]. Include filters for [criteria] and sort options.
```

### Role-Based Access
```
Create role-based access control with the following user types:
- Admin: [permissions]
- Editor: [permissions]
- Viewer: [permissions]

Update the UI to show only relevant actions based on the user's role.
```

## Best Practices Reminders

1. **Be specific** about what you want to achieve
2. **Break complex tasks** into smaller, incremental steps
3. **Reference existing components** when requesting similar functionality
4. **Provide examples** when possible
5. **Include error context** when debugging
6. **Specify constraints** to guide the AI's solution
7. **Review small changes** before requesting additional features
8. **Be polite** - it actually improves results!
