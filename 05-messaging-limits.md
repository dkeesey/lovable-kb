# Messaging Limits

Understanding daily and monthly message limits for Lovable.

LLMs are expensive, which is why Lovable limits the daily and/or monthly messages that you can send.

Messages do not roll over. Unused messages will **not accumulate** from day to day or month to month.

## All Plans

* **Daily limit:** 5 free messages per day

Designed to give users a chance to explore and experience Lovable's features at no cost.

## Free Plan

* 5 free messages per day (chat or edit mode)
* Maximum of 30 messages per month

## Available Paid Plans

Each paid plan includes a set number of allocated messages, plus 5 free daily messages available to all users.

| Plan | Daily Messages | Monthly Messages | Paid Limit Multiplier | Total Messages Per Month |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Starter** | 5 | 100 | - | **250** |
| **Launch** | 5 | 250 | 2.5x | **400** |

## Credits Consumption Details

### Chat Mode vs Edit Mode

* 1 Chat Mode message = 1 Edit Mode message = 1 message
* All pricing tiers have access to Chat Mode
* There is no separate message count in settings for Chat Mode
* Workaround: If you use Edit Mode without asking the AI to write code, it won't count towards your message limitâ€”but Chat Mode functionalities won't be available in that case

### 'Try to Fix' Button

Messages triggered by "Ask the AI to fix" don't count toward your usage limits only if pressed on the button. If you are trying to fix errors with an additional prompt, that counts as message credit.

All other messages count regardless of their outcome.

## Upgrading and Downgrading Plans

### Upgrading

When upgrading your plan, the cost is adjusted based on the time left in your current billing cycle. You'll only pay the difference between what you've already paid and the cost of the new plan for the remaining days in the billing period. This amount will be charged immediately.

### Downgrading

When downgrading your plan:

* **No immediate changes** occur to your subscription.
* The downgrade will take effect at the **start of the next billing period**, at which point you will be billed for the new, lower-cost plan.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Pricing Changes or Charges

Lovable sends community and email notifications about any upcoming pricing changes. Please ensure your email is up-to-date in your account settings.

### Errors During Payment Setup

Occasionally, payment setups may fail due to issues with Stripe. If this occurs, double-check your payment details and retry. If problems persist, contact the support team for assistance.

### Change Payment Cards

You can update your payment method anytime by navigating to **Account Settings > Plans & Billing** and managing your details through Stripe.

### Paid Users Losing Access

This typically happens due to billing issues (e.g., expired cards). Ensure your payment method is valid to avoid interruptions.

### Resolving Overages or Refunds

If you experience message overages or require a refund, reach out to the support team. They handle these on a case-by-case basis to ensure a fair resolution.
